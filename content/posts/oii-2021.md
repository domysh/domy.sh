In my second partecipation at the [Italian Olympics of IT](https://www.olimpiadi-informatica.it/), I won the [bronze medal](https://stats.olinfo.it/contestant/a263143ed7935ece6a80b4dcf323887d) having been passed for the second time to the national competition. In the hard study for this coding and logical competition, I acquired a lot of advanced skills in the programming field, learning the technicques and the methodologies of programming and competitive programming.
