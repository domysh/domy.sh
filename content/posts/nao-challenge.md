By participating in the editions of the [Nao Challenge](https://www.naochallenge.it/en/the-contest/) 2019 and 2020 together with the [Just Nao](https://iissjustnao.wordpress.com/chi-siamo/) team of which I was a part, we have acquired skills of various kinds, from the technical ones, to those of speaking and presentation. In the 2019's edition our team arrived at the final, after having faced all the tests, we got the social prize, thanks to the activities on our media. Instead the 2020's edition has been blocked due to the corona virus emergency.
