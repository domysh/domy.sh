In 2018, me and 2 other companions have decided to create a team for the [Letsapp](https://www.samsung.com/it/campaign/solve-for-tomorrow/) 2018 project that was intriguing us and in which we participated. We passed the first selection and partecipated at the hackaton in the Samsung Smart Arena, gaining the 3rd place. Our idea was about an application that fight the game dipendency.
