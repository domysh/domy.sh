[CyberChallenge.IT](https://cyberchallenge.it/) is the first Italian cybersecurity training program for talented young people from high schools and universities. In this occasion acquired my basic and advance notions about cybersecurity about hardware, software and web security, cryptography, cryptographic protocols and more. I won the first place at the [Politecnico di Bari](https://www.poliba.it/) in this occasion, and this allowed me to enter in [Team Italy 2020](https://teamitaly.eu/2020.html).
